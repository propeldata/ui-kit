The Propel UI Kit is an open-source library of React components to quickly build great-looking dashboards and data visualizations.

## Why the Propel UI Kit?

Building data visualization UIs is never easy. Implementing designs from scratch is time-consuming, fetching data requires a lot of backend logic, and there are always a lot of edge cases to deal with, like the intricacies of the different time ranges, or handling the loading and error states.

Charting libraries like ChartJS, Echarts, Highcharts, or D3 are great but still need a lot of work to build them into elegant and cohesive product experiences. On the flip side, embedding third-party chart widgets via iFrames into your customer-facing product results in an inflexible, slow, and inelegant product experience.

That's why we built the Propel UI Kit. Its component-based approach allows you to move fast, look great, and focus your efforts on building components that are unique to your product.

## Core principles

The Propel UI Kit is an open-source project built on five core principles:

- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** Charting libraries are great, let's make them better. We built the UI Kit on top of all the power and efficiency of ChartJS.

- **Work and look great out-of-box.** The components work and look great out of the box. You can drop them into your app with minor color customizations and you'll be off to a great start.

- **Extremely customizable.** You can customize their styles, look and feel, and error and loading experience to always feel native to your product.

- **Built in React for React.** We built them in React for React frontends. No cross-framework abstractions and no unnecessary baggage.

- **They work with or without Propel's APIs.** You can use them by themselves in static mode or with the Propel API in connected mode.

## Key features

All components share the same set of key features:

- **They are responsive.** Components are responsive out of the box. They render well on desktops and laptops as well as phones and tablets.

- **They handle loading and error states for you.** No need to sweat the details of handling the different states. We've done that for you.

- **They fetch the data for you.** Components can automatically fetch the data from the Propel API when used in connected mode.

Individual components have other key features that we highlight on the component documentation pages.

## Components

## Getting Started with Propel

To leverage the full power of Propel UI Kit + API, you'll need a Propel Account. If you don't have a Propel Account yet, you can [try Propel for free](https://propeldata.com/get-started).

You can learn more about Propel by reading our [API docs](https://propeldata.com/docs).

Once you have your account set up, you'll need to provide your account's access token to use Propel APIs. You can authenticate and generate an access token by following the steps outlined in [the Propel GraphQL Authentication guide](https://propeldata.com/docs/api/authentication#step-2-generate-an-access-token).

## Usage

The components in the Propel UI Kit are available in two modes: "Static" and "Connected".

In the "Static" mode, you fetch the data yourself and provide it to the component.

In the "Connected" mode, the component automatically fetches the data from the Propel API. You don't need to configure a GraphQL client or handle loading and error states.

### Static Mode

In the "Static" mode, the component will display the data you provide.

Let's take our [@propeldata/react-time-series](https://github.com/propeldata/ui-kit/tree/main/packages/react/time-series) component as an example. If you want to fetch the data on your own instead of delegating it to the library, you can do so using the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
import { TimeSeries } from '@propeldata/react-time-series'

const labels = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']

const values = [0, 1000, 200, 3000, 4000, 500, 7000]

function WeekSalesChart() {
  return <TimeSeries labels={labels} values={values} />
}
```

You can customize the component using your own styles.

</p>

### Connected Mode: The Power of Propel at one import away

In the "Connected" mode, the component will fetch and render the Propel data for you. To use this mode, all you need to do is pass the query prop, which configures the Metric query.

Here is an example using our [@propeldata/react-counter](https://github.com/propeldata/ui-kit/tree/main/packages/react/time-series) component:

```javascript
import { Counter } from '@propeldata/react-counter'

function SalesCountLabel() {
  const queryOptions = {
    accessToken: '<PROPEL_ACCESS_TOKEN>',
    metric: 'salesCount',
    timeRange: {
      relative: 'PREVIOUS_WEEK'
    },
    granularity: 'DAY'
  }

  return (
    <p>
      We reached <Counter query={queryOptions} /> last week.
    </p>
  )
}
```

In this mode, the component will handle the loading and error states for you, making it even easier to use.

## Customization: Making It Your Own

We designed the Propel UI Kit to be highly customizable and easy to incorporate into your front-end applications. Here are some of the customization options available to you:

### Styles

You can apply your own custom styles to each component using the Styles interface. This interface includes a wide range of properties to customize your charts, such as font, canvas, tooltip, bar, line, and point.

For example, to change the color of the bars in your time series chart, you can use the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
function MyChart() {
  // source code

  const styles = {
    bar: {
      backgroundColor: '#532AB4'
    }
  }

  return <TimeSeries styles={styles} />
}
```

This will change the color of the bars to a shade of purple, as shown in the following image:

</p>

### Errors

You can also provide your own custom error messages by using the error prop. This will enable you to provide more accurate feedback to your users in case of technical errors or other issues.

For example, to display a custom error message when the chart data cannot be loaded, you can use the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
function MyChart() {
  // source code

  const title = 'Unable to connect'
  const body = 'Sorry we are not able to connect at this time due to a technical error.'

  return <TimeSeries error={{ title, body }} />
}
```

This will display a custom error message with a title and body text, as shown in the following image:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://storybook.propeldata.com/images/error.png"/>
</p>

By customizing your Propel UI Kit components in this way, you can create unique, user-friendly data visualizations that fit seamlessly into your front-end applications.
