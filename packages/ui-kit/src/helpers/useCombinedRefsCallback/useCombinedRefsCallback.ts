/**
 * Custom React hook that creates a combined ref and provides a callback to set it.
 * It utilizes `useCombinedRefs` to merge `forwardedRef` and `innerRef` into a single ref (`combinedRef`).
 * Additionally, it manages a state (`componentContainer`) to store the DOM element associated with the ref.
 * The `setRef` callback is used to update both the `componentContainer` state and the `combinedRef`.
 * This hook is useful for components that need to expose their DOM node to parent components while maintaining an internal ref.
 *
 * @param {Ref<T>} forwardedRef - The forwarded ref.
 * @param {Ref<T>} innerRef - The internal ref.
 * @returns An object containing `componentContainer`, `combinedRef`, `ref`, and `setRef`.
