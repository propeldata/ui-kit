# Propel UI Kit

The Propel UI Kit is a data visualization and dashboard React component library to quickly build awesome-looking
analytics into your apps.

## Why the Propel UI Kit?

Building data visualization UIs is never easy. Implementing designs from scratch is time-consuming, fetching data
requires a lot of backend logic, and there are always a lot of edge cases to deal with, like the intricacies of the
different time ranges, or handling the loading and error states.

Charting libraries like Chart.js, ECharts, Highcharts, or D3 are great but still need a lot of work to build them into
elegant and cohesive product experiences. On the flip side, embedding third-party chart widgets via iframes into your
customer-facing product results in an inflexible, slow, and inelegant product experience.

That's why we built the Propel UI Kit. Its component-based approach allows you to move fast, make it look great, and
focus your efforts on building components that are unique to your product.

### Core principles

The Propel UI Kit is an open-source project built on five core principles:

- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** Charting libraries are great, let's make them better. We built the UI Kit on top of all
  the power and efficiency of Chart.js.
- **Work and look great out-of-box.** The components work and look great out of the box. You can drop them into your app
  with minor color customization, and you'll be off to a great start.
- **Extremely customizable.** You can customize their styles, look and feel, and error and loading experience to always
  feel native to your product.
- **Built in React for React.** We built them in React for React frontends. No cross-framework abstractions and no
  unnecessary baggage.

They work with or without Propel's APIs. You can use them by themselves in Static mode or with the Propel API in
Connected mode.

## Key features

All components share the same set of key features:

- **They are responsive.** Components are responsive out of the box. They render well on desktops and laptops as well as
  phones and tablets.
- **They handle loading and error states for you.** No need to sweat the details of handling the different states. We've
  done that for you.
- **They fetch the data for you.** Components can automatically fetch the data from the Propel API when used in
  connected mode.

Individual components have other key features that we highlight on the component documentation pages.
