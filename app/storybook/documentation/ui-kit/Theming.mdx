# Theming

The theme of a UI determines essential visual elements, including the colors of components, the depth of shadows, and
the overall light or dark appearance of the interface. We provide both light and dark themes, with the light theme set
as the default.

## ThemeProvider

To customize the theme, it's necessary to employ the `ThemeProvider` component, which injects a theme into your
application. This step, however, is not mandatory as UI Kit components are pre-equipped with a default theme.

The `ThemeProvider` utilizes React's [context mechanism](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) to
propagate the theme to the components. Therefore, ensure that `ThemeProvider` is positioned as a parent to the
components you wish to customize. Further details are available in
the&#160;<LinkTo kind="API/ThemeProvider" story="overview">API section</LinkTo>.

## Theme configuration

Adjusting the theme configuration variables is the most effective approach to customize the UI Kit according to your
unique needs.

### Tokens

Each theme token is represented as a
[CSS Custom Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).These tokens can
also be accessed from JavaScript using the `theme.getVar` method. For example, you can use `--propel-accent-11` in CSS
and the following approach in JavaScript:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format="dedent"
  dark
  code={`
    import { useTheme } from "@propeldata/ui-kit";

    function YourComponent() {
      const theme = useTheme();

      return (
        <div style={{ color: theme.getVar('--propel-accent-11') }}>
          Hello world!
        </div>
      );
    }

`} />

The CSS Custom Properties are prefixed with `--propel-` which helps to prevent any potential naming collisions with
other stylesheets. Further details are available in the <LinkTo kind="API/ThemeTokenProps" story="overview"> API
section</LinkTo>.

### Customizing the Theme

The `ThemeProvider` component allows theme customization through its `className` or `style` props.

<SourceCode
  of={ThemeProviderStories.ThemeProviderCustomizeViaCssClassNameStory}
  transform={(code, context) =>
    `${prettier(context.parameters.rawCss, { parser: 'css' })}\n${prettier(
      context.parameters.codeTemplate(code, context)
    )}`
  }

/>
