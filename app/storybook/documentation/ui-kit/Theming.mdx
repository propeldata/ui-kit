# Theming

The theme of a UI determines essential visual elements, including the colors of components, the depth of shadows, and
the overall light or dark appearance of the interface. We provide both light and dark themes, with the light theme set
as the default.

## ThemeProvider

To customize the theme, it's necessary to employ the `ThemeProvider` component, which injects a theme into your
application. This step, however, is not mandatory as UI Kit components are pre-equipped with a default theme.

The `ThemeProvider` utilizes React's [context mechanism](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) to
propagate the theme to the components. Therefore, ensure that `ThemeProvider` is positioned as a parent to the
components you wish to customize. Further details are available in
the&#160;<LinkTo kind="API/ThemeProvider" story="overview">API section</LinkTo>.

## Theme configuration

Adjusting the theme configuration variables is the most effective approach to customize the UI Kit according to your
unique needs.

### Tokens

Each token in the theme object is represented as both a
[CSS Custom Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) and a corresponding
JavaScript property, e.g. `--propel-text-md-regular-font-family` and `textMdRegularFontFamily`. The CSS Custom
Properties are prefixed with `--propel-` which helps to prevent any potential naming collisions with other stylesheets.
Further details are available in the <LinkTo kind="API/ThemeTokenProps" story="overview">API section</LinkTo>.

### Default values

The content in `themes.module.scss` defines design tokens for a UI Kit, supporting both light and dark themes. It
includes typography styles for various text sizes and weights, spacing units, and border radii. A comprehensive colour
palette covers text, borders, and backgrounds for both themes. Deprecated variables are also listed for phasing out
older styles.

<Source language="css" format="dedent" dark code={rawThemesScss} />

### Customizing the Theme

The `ThemeProvider` component allows theme customization through its `theme` prop.

#### Customization via CSS Class:

<SourceCode
  of={ThemeProviderStories.ThemeProviderCustomizeViaCssClassNameStory}
  transform={(code, context) =>
    `${prettier(context.parameters.rawCss, { parser: 'css' })}\n${prettier(
      context.parameters.codeTemplate(code, context)
    )}`
  }
  shown
/>

#### Customization via JavaScript properties:

<SourceCode of={ThemeProviderStories.ThemeProviderCustomizeViaJSPropsStory} shown />

This method enables the seamless integration of design tokens from a CSS-in-JS library, like
[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/).
