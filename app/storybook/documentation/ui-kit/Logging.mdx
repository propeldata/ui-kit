# Logging

The Propel UI Kit logs all errors to the browser's console by default. You can configure this behavior using the
`LogProvider` component. For example, if your app contains a Counter component like this:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format="dedent"
  dark
  code={`
    import { Counter } from "@propeldata/ui-kit"

    function App() {
      return <Counter />;
    }

`} />

The `LogProvider` utilizes React's [context mechanism](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) to
propagate the logger settings to components. To log specific components, simply nest them within a `LogProvider`
component. You can then set the log level to one of the following: "error", "warn", "info", or "debug".

<SourceCode of={LogStories.LogLevelError} shown />

<Controls of={LogStories.LogLevelError} />

Additionally, you can disable all logs by setting log level to "off" (for example, in your production build).

Finally, we recommend configuring at most one LogProvider per app.
