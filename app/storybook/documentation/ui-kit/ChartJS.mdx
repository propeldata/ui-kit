# Chart Configuration

We built the UI Kit on top of all the power and efficiency of Chart.js.

## Global Chart.js configuration

You can extend or override default Chart.js settings of all chart components by providing a `globalChartConfigProps`
function to the `ThemeProvider` component. This function accepts the
[config object](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/) from Chart.js as an argument and should return the
modified config object with your configurations applied.

## Chart configuration

You can customize the chart settings at the component level by utilizing the `chartConfigProps` prop. This prop accepts
a function that receives the chart's current configuration object specific to a chart type. Within this function, you
can modify and return the configuration object to tailor the chart's appearance and behavior to your needs. The changes
made through `chartConfigProps` will only affect the particular instance of the chart.
