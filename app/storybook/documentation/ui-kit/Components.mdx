# Components

We designed the Propel UI Kit to be highly customizable and easy to incorporate into your front-end applications. Here
are some of the customization options available to you:

## Styles

You can apply your own custom styles to each component using the `style` and `className` properties in the standard way.
It is possible to customize the chart even further
by&#160;<LinkTo kind="Customization/Chart Configuration" story="overview">using the Chart.js API directly</LinkTo>.

For example, to change the color of the bars in your time series chart, you can use the following code:

<SourceCode of={TimeSeriesStories.CustomStyleStory} shown />

## Errors

You can also provide your own custom error messages by using the error prop. This will enable you to provide more
accurate feedback to your users in case of technical errors or other issues.

For example, to display a custom error message when the chart data cannot be loaded, you can use the following
JavaScript code:

<SourceCode of={TimeSeriesStories.ErrorStory} shown />

By customizing your Propel UI Kit components in this way, you can create unique, user-friendly data visualizations that
fit seamlessly into your front-end applications.
