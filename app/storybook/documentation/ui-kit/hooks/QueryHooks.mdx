# Query Hooks

Propel's UI Kit provides prebuilt React components that are responsible for querying data from Propel's GraphQL API and visualizing that data. 
These prebuilt components integrate with the UI Kit's <LinkTo kind="Customization/Theming" story="overview">ThemeProvider</LinkTo>, allowing you to customize each 
component's appearance. However, sometimes you need more control than what CSS and the `ThemeProvider` can offer. Additionally, you may want to combine data 
from multiple sources within a single component.  

This is where Query Hooks come in. Query Hooks are custom [React Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) that allow you to query data 
from Propel's GraphQL API. With Query Hooks, you can build custom components that query multiple data sources and visualize them exactly the way you want to. 
For example, if there is a specific charting library you want to use, you can integrate with it using Query Hooks.  

Additionally, Query Hooks integrate with the UI Kit's <LinkTo kind="Getting started/Authentication" story="overview">AccessTokenProvider</LinkTo>. This means you don't have to 
take care of access token management when using Query Hooks. You can continue to configure your access token in one place, 
and the Query Hooks will automatically re-fetch data when the access token changes.
