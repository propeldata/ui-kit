# `useCounter`

The `useCounter` is a proposed Query Hook in the Propelâ€™s UI Kit library. This Hook abstracts the code for querying the GraphQL API, allowing customers 
to implement their own components using the Hook. The `useCounter` hook would return the result of a query, which could then be used in a 
component for displaying data. This makes it easier for customers to implement their own components while leveraging the query logic provided by Propel.
This implementation allows for the customer to use it in their own components, such as a Fraction component that displays two Counters as a fraction.
