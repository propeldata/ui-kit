# Dark mode

Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.

## Overview

Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or
styling.

### Basic usage

By default, the root `ThemeProvider` appearance is `light`.

<SourceCode of={TimeSeriesStories.LightThemeStory} shown />

To set a different appearance pass it via the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

<SourceCode of={TimeSeriesStories.DrakThemeStory} shown />
