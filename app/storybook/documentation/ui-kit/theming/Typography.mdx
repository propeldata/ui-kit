# Typography

Guidance for using and tuning typography.

## Base component

Use <LinkTo kind="Components/Typography" story="Overview">Typography</LinkTo> component to render text. This component
has `size` prop and map to the underlying type system to ensure consistent typography throughout your app.

It can render text using various semantic HTML elements (e.g., `h1`, `p`, `span`) while maintaining consistent styling.
It adapts its underlying DOM element based on the context or props, ensuring proper document structure and
accessibility.
