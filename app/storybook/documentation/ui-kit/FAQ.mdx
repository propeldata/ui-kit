# Frequently Asked Questions

This section provides concise answers to common questions about our UI Kit library. Covering topics from setup to
advanced customization, it's designed to assist you in making the most of our UI Kit. For queries not addressed here,
our support team is always ready to help.

## How can I access the DOM element?

All UI Kit components rendering DOM elements forward their ref to the underlying DOM component. This allows for the
retrieval of DOM elements by accessing the ref attached to these UI Kit components.

## Do I have to use a CSS-in-JS library (like Emotion) or preprocessor (like SASS) to style my components?

No, you can use any styling solution you prefer. UI Kit works even with plain CSS.

## When should I use inline-style vs. CSS?

As a general guideline, reserve inline styles primarily for dynamic style properties. Using CSS offers several benefits,
including:

- Automatic prefixing
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Support for media queries
- Use of keyframes
