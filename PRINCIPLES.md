# Why the Propel UI Kit?

Building data visualization UIs is never easy. Implementing designs from scratch is time-consuming, fetching data requires a lot of backend logic, and there are always a lot of edge cases to deal with, like the intricacies of the different time ranges, or handling the loading and error states.

Charting libraries like Chart.js, ECharts, Highcharts, or D3 are great but still need a lot of work to build them into elegant and cohesive product experiences. On the flip side, embedding third-party chart widgets via iframes into your customer-facing product results in an inflexible, slow, and inelegant product experience.

That's why we built the Propel UI Kit. Its component-based approach allows you to move fast, look great, and focus your efforts on building components that are unique to your product.

## Core principles

The Propel UI Kit is an open-source project built on five core principles:

- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** Charting libraries are great, let's make them better. We built the UI Kit on top of all the power and efficiency of Chart.js.

- **Work and look great out-of-box.** The components work and look great out of the box. You can drop them into your app with minor color customization, and you'll be off to a great start.

- **Extremely customizable.** You can customize their styles, look and feel, and error and loading experience to always feel native to your product.

- **Built in React for React.** We built them in React for React frontends. No cross-framework abstractions and no unnecessary baggage.

- **They work with or without Propel's APIs.** You can use them by themselves in Static mode or with the Propel API in Connected mode.
